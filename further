🔁 1. Add Response Generation (B2B SaaS Use Case)

💡 Auto-generate company responses to reviews (like on Google Play/App Store).

Prompt example:
“Generate a professional, polite response to this customer complaint…”

Tools:

ML.GENERATE_TEXT → customized prompt

GeminiTextGenerator → better flexibility in Python

Result:
Now you're automating both insights and action, which is more valuable.

🧭 2. Segment Insights by Customer Type

💡 Cluster reviews by star rating, product category, or even keyword patterns and generate segment-wise insights.

Example Output:

"Among 2-star reviews, the top complaint is slow delivery."

Tools:

GROUP BY + ML.GENERATE_TEXT on subsets

Use AI.GENERATE_TABLE for insights in tabular format

🤖 3. Create a “CX Executive Assistant”

💡 Turn your summarizer into an interactive assistant that:

Pulls up insights for any product

Highlights unusual patterns (e.g., spike in bad reviews)

Recommends actions (like fixing shipping process)

This narrative (an “executive assistant” built with BigQuery AI) is unique and story-driven — great for hackathons.

📦 4. Multimodal Extension (to make it rare)

💡 Combine review summaries with product images or marketing copy and detect mismatches.

Example: "The listing says 'durable', but reviews mention it broke."

Use Object Tables + AI.GENERATE_BOOL or GeminiTextGenerator.

This would edge into the Multimodal track but make your AI Architect submission more unique.

🛡️ 5. Trust & Safety Angle

💡 Identify potentially fake or AI-generated reviews using GenAI.

Prompt: “Does this review sound generic, repeated, or artificial?”

This is uncommon, very timely, and could have real business value.
